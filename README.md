#elevator pitch
I want to make a webapp that allows users to plug in some of their Magic the Gathering commander decks and get a full 100 card deck recommendation.  It will take each deck, find out what theme of deck it is (example: tribal, combo, artifact), power level (determined by factors too complex for this pitch), how pricey it should be (read secondary market card prices), what colors, etc.  It will provide a link to a few other websites and load the list into a buy order and be a click away from buying a new deck.
